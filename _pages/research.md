          A key challenge for targeted antipoverty programs in developing countries is that policymakers must rely on estimated rather than observed income, which leads to substantial targeting errors.
          I propose a statistical decision framework in which a benevolent planner, subject to a budget constraint and equipped only with noisy income estimates, allocates cash transfers to the poorest individuals.
          In this setting, the commonly used plug-in rule, which allocates transfers based on point estimates, is inadmissible and uniformly dominated by a shrinkage-based alternative.
          Building on this result, I propose an empirical Bayes (EB) targeting rule.
          I show that the regret of the empirical Bayes rule converges at the same rate as that of the posterior mean estimator, despite applying a nonsmooth transformation to it.
          Simulations show that the EB rule delivers large improvements over the plug-in approach in an idealized setting and modest but consistent gains in a more realistic application.

          This paper develops a statistical decision theory framework for selecting the treatment assignment probability in two-wave experimental designs with finite samples.
          While the Neyman allocation minimizes the estimator's variance when outcome variances are known, its feasible version, estimated from a small pilot sample, can perform poorly.
          I show that the minimax regret-optimal rule corresponds to balanced assignment, entirely ignoring pilot data.
          Building on this insight, I propose a Confidence-Calibrated Minimax Regret (CCMR) rule that uses the pilot to construct a data-driven set of plausible variance configurations and then minimizes worst-case regret over that restricted space.
          The CCMR rule coincides with the balanced assignment when the pilot is uninformative, but converges to the feasible Neyman allocation (FNA) with increasing pilot size.
          This structure guarantees, with high probability, uniformly bounded regret in finite samples and vanishing regret in the limit.
          I extend the framework in three directions: (i) incorporating known variance ordering; (ii) generalizing to multi-arm designs; and (iii) selecting the optimal pilot sample size.
          Simulations show that the CCMR rule consistently outperforms the FNA, particularly when the pilot sample is small.
