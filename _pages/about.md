Welcome! I am Ph.D. student in the Department of Economics at Brown University. 

My research focuses on applied econometrics and statistical decision theory. I aim to develop methods that help researchers and policymakers make better use of data for real-world decisions. My current work centers on **poverty targeting** and **experimental design**.

This website includes my [CV](/files/cv.pdf), current [research](/publications), and other materials related to my work.
